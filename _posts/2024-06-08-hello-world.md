Sitting down on my balcony, there are many sights and sounds to behold. There are a variety of birds singing their songs and others are flying at all different altitudes and speeds. I also hear the sounds of volleyballs being hit while the accompanying sounds of the buffalo's groans and Aunty's oil sizzling add rhythm to the overall noise present in the valley. It has been hard to collect my thoughts as my transition from taking a 2-week orientation at Peace Corps headquarters in Kathmandu to my permanent site (located in Syangja district) has been a change in pace. While I'd love to claim otherwise, I am a creature by habit. I tend to try and establish routines and a small trustworthy group of friends no matter where I go. From the friends I've made from Peace Corps volunteers and from people in my town, I am one step closer to achieving a routine that can help me adjust to the new way of living here in Nepal.

In my short time here, I have already learned so much and found the cracks in my perception of life on this side of the globe. I also constantly draw many parallels to life here in Nepal to life as I know it in Mexico. I am always pleasantly surprised at how many similarities I find, rather than focusing on the differences. For example, हावा
(hava), or air, sounds just like the spanish word *agua* for water. I also constantly get many comments on my apperance and how confused people are when they hear I am not Nepali. With much ethnic diversity, there are some common traits that most Nepali people share: brown hair, brown eyes, brown skin. Many other parts of Latin America share these same traits; another way we are more similar than different. 

Where I find more differences is how life is perceived her versus in the Western part of the world. In Nepal, I have come to cherish the rarity of both milk and meat. With most of my meals consiting of more rice and vegetables, meat here isn't widely available. The people raise chickens, goats, and buffalos. The chickens provide eggs, goats provide milk, and the buffalo provides milk. Chickens and goats have complete mobility to roam and graze as they please; they mate and give birth to offspring and when the time comes, they provide meat for the people to consume. Life here may appear slower and simpler but I've come to find that life isn't one defined way of living. There is only a life an individual leads in their given environment. Relationship with nature exists more prevalently here and everything provided is one of out necessity and not excessivity. It is refreshing to withness nature more wholistically as sometimes in the States, living in an urban environment, there is more disconnection from nature and appreciation for food. 

The people here too have been an adjustment. My host brother and sister, on the first day of meeting served me the most refreshing glass of juice, as the weather outside was around 95 degrees. Not only are they kind, but also extremely patient. I don't speak much Nepali outside of using simple sentences and the present tense, but they always give me room to think and try to help me out with my Nepali. I call them Aunty and Uncle (at their request <3>) and have found my integration all that much easier. I feel adopted into their family, making the house I live in that much closer to feeling like a third home. There are some aspects of culture I have found to be interesting (to say the least). My first month, and even now, people come up to me and touch my hair or slap my back or try to hold my hand. It is apart of the culture for the Nepali people to have more physical contact than what I am used to so it has been a bit jarring. Anything I eat, I usually have one to three people watching me eat, not saying anything. Me eating is their form of entertainment for 15 minutes. Also something I find a bit jarring.

Water here is a precious resource. And rarely wasted. But it is also in abundance in my village. There are many water springs that have fresh water running of out them that have been naturally filtered through the mountains. To collect water is a tough job. To store water, people use green plastic 2 liter bottles of either empty Mountain Dew or Sprite brands. Then carrying all empty bottles to the <i>chola</i>, we fill up the bottles with fresh spring water and carry them back to the house. After doing it, the journey for fresh water also made me appreciate filters that are installed in kitchens back in the States. But this experience has forced me to realize how vital water is and teaching me to moderate how much I should use in a given day.


With many more things I could write, I will end things here. until the next time I feel a sporadic urge to blog, see you guys soon!
