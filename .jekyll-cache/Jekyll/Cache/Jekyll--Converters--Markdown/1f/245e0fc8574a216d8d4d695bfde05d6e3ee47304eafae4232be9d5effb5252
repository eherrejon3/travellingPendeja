I"¶<p>Sitting down on my balcony, there are many sights and sounds to behold. There are a variety of birds singing their songs and others are flying at all different altitudes and speeds. I also hear the sounds of volleyballs being hit while the accompanying sounds of the buffaloâ€™s groans and Auntyâ€™s oil sizzling add rhythm to the overall noise present in the valley. It has been hard to collect my thoughts as my transition from taking a 2-week orientation at Peace Corps headquarters in Kathmandu to my permanent site (located in Syangja district) has been a change in pace. While Iâ€™d love to claim otherwise, I am a creature by habit. I tend to try and establish routines and a small trustworthy group of friends no matter where I go. From the friends Iâ€™ve made from Peace Corps volunteers and from people in my town, I am one step closer to achieving a routine that can help me adjust to the new way of living here in Nepal.</p>

<p>In my short time here, I have already learned so much and found the cracks in my perception of life on this side of the globe. I also constantly draw many parallels to life here in Nepal to life as I know it in Mexico. I am always pleasantly surprised at how many similarities I find, rather than focusing on the differences. For example, à¤¹à¤¾à¤µà¤¾
(hava), or air, sounds just like the spanish word <em>agua</em> for water. I also constantly get many comments on my apperance and how confused people are when they hear I am not Nepali. With much ethnic diversity, there are some common traits that most Nepali people share: brown hair, brown eyes, brown skin. Many other parts of Latin America share these same traits; another way we are more similar than different.</p>
